# Cartify E-Commerce Analytics Dashboard  

An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Cartify’s e-commerce operations across **sales, profitability, discounts, logistics, and returns**.

## 📌 Objective  
Use Cartify’s sales, operational, and customer data to:  

- Identify profit-driving regions, segments, and products  
- Detect inefficiencies impacting profitability (discounts, delayed deliveries, returns)  
- Assess logistics and delivery performance  
- Analyze customer returns and retention risks  
- Apply the Pareto 80/20 principle to highlight top profit contributors  

## 🗂 Dashboard Highlights  
- **Sales & Profitability:** Regional and segment performance, top vs. loss-making areas  
- **Discount Analysis:** Discounts vs. profitability correlations  
- **Logistics Performance:** Delivery speed, average delivery days, on-time rates  
- **Returns & Pareto:** High-return products, return trends, and top 20% products driving ~80% of profits  

## 💡 Key Insights  
1. **All Regions Are Profitable, but Corporate Clients Lag Behind** – Corporate segment shows the lowest profit margins; re-evaluating discounts can boost profitability.  
2. **Aggressive Discounts on Electronics Are Not Paying Off** – Capping discounts and promoting high-margin bundles can improve transaction profitability.  
3. **Delivery Delays in the South Are a Bottleneck** – Average delivery time 4.54 days; investigating fulfillment centers and regional courier partnerships recommended.  
4. **“Apparel” Is the Main Cause of Product Returns** – ~11.5% of all returns; enhance product pages with sizing guides, customer photos, and reviews to reduce returns.  
5. **A Few “Superstar” Products Drive Most Profit** – Fashion Accessories & Footwear deliver ~80% of total profit; increase marketing budget and ensure constant stock.
